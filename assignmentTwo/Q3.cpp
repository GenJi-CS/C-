/*Question 3
A rectangle can be deÔ¨Åned by two points (top-left and bottom-right or top-right and bottom-left). Implement a class called Rectangle 
using the Point class we saw during the lecture. 

The Rectangle class must have the following methods:
void setPoints(const Point &, const Point &)
void getDimensions(double &, double &)
double perimeter()

Write the main() function to check if your implementation works correctly.*/
