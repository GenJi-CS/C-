Constructor

A special kind of class member function that is automatically called when an object of that class is instantiated.
Typically used to initialize member variables of the class to appropriate default or user-provided values, or to do any setup steps necessary for the class to be used.(eg: open a file or database)
Unlike normal member functions, constructors have specific rule for how they must be named:
    Constructors must have the same name as the class(with the same capitalization)
    Constructors have no return type

Recall the Point class
//Point.h

#pragma once
class Point
{
    private:
        double x,y;
    
    public:
        Point();//Constructor Declaration
        void print() const
        {
            std::cout<<"x="<<x<<",y="<<y<<std::endl;
        }
}
